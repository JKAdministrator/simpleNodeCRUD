# simpleNodeCRUD

- A simple CRUD API that allows you to manage notes (in memory, without using a database)
- Use [express](http://expressjs.com/) for routes
- To test the api you can download [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or similar applications
- The project contains some examples in the /requests/ folder to test locally using the [Visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com) extension [REST Client](https://github.com/Huachao/vscode-restclient) in conjunction with [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)
